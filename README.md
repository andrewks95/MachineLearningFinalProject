# MachineLearningFinalProject

# In order to run this file, you will need to install a number of different packages.

# Firstly, you will need to install NLTK and Tensorflow. In the end, I did not use TextBlob, but you should install that too.

# Any steps needed to execute the code should be present.

# The exception is at the end of the code. Unfortunately, due to limited system resources, and my limited understanding, I was not able to overcome an error and correctly generate an embedded features layer.
